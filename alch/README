scripts to perform bulk transformation of molten salt to an ideal gas
this lets you obtain the absolute Gibbs free energy / chemical potential of a liquid at a specified state point

you should first first run npt_eq.in to obtain the correct volume 
then run nvt_eq.in for an initial configuration
then run bmh2lj.in at each lambda point
them run lj2ideal.in at each lambda point
run pullNumbers.py afterwards to calculate relevant energies and generate dU/dlambda plots


*in principle* this should work for arbitrary force fields/other systems but that'll need a few months of proper vetting
